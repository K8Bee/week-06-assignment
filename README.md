<!-- Git flow:
 starting from terminal, when in git:(main), type:
 git checkout -b newBranchName
 git add .
 git commit -m "commit message"
 git push --set-upstream origin newBranchName
 Then go to the GitHub repo and click: "compare & pull request", then "create pull request", then "merge pull request", then "confirm merge", then "delete branch"
 back in terminal, type:
 git checkout main
 git pull
 Note: can start a new branch straight away, or make changes and then create the branch as above just before adding, pushing, pulling, deleting the branch
