<!-- Git flow:
 starting from terminal, when in git:(main), type:
 git checkout -b newBranchName
 git add .
 git commit -m "commit message"
 git push --set-upstream origin newBranchName
 Then go to the GitHub repo and click: "compare & pull request", then "create pull request", then "merge pull request", then "confirm merge", then "delete branch"
 back in terminal, type:
 git checkout main
 git pull
 Note: can start a new branch straight away, or make changes and then create the branch as above just before adding, pushing, pulling, deleting the branch

# Reflections

<!-- Provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file. -->

## Required

‚Ä¢ üéØ What requirements did you achieve?
TBC
‚Ä¢ üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Yes, I took much longer to do everything that I have done so far, that I ran out of time for this user story:
"As a user who navigates with a keyboard, I want to be able to tab through the interactive elements (like thumbnails and buttons) in a logical order."
‚Ä¢ üéØ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Did not have the knowledge instinctively, would need time to go and look up how to do this.

## Optional

üèπ add any other reflections you would like to share about this submission, for example:
‚Ä¢ Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
‚Ä¢ What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
‚Ä¢ What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
‚Ä¢ What went really well and what could have gone better?
I found it hard to work out my component nesting, how many components layers to have (hence the need for a wireframe) that I struggled to work out where to put blocks of code, how to set up props for correct passing/ accepting (drilling) etc. and this made Git branching difficult as I often didn't have or stick to a set task, I went with whichever thing I (thought I) understood the most to do next.
